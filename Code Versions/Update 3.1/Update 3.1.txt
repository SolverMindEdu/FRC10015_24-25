Update 3.1:

Heading Snap Update:
	-> General issue update for Heading snap Update with limelight to speaker.

Current Issues:
	-> Choreo Causing Memory issue with RoboRIO. Currently when you want to delete a choreo file or trajectory file the RoboRIO still remembers the name 	of the file or trajectory which causes the RoboRio to constantly crashing.

Current Solutions:
	-> When choreo causes the RoboRIO to crash ftp into the RoboRIO which in this case is 10.100.15 therefore you would go into files and type 		ftp://10.100.15 and go to /home/lvuser/ and delete the deploy folder.
